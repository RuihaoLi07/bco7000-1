# Plan for today

- Types of variables

- Working with factors

- Working with text (=strings)

- Working with dates
---
#Types of data

- Discrete variables

- Continous variables

- Categorical/Ordinal variables = factors

- Textual information: what is specific about it?

- Dates: what is specific about working with dates?

#Dataset

We will be working with a pizza dataset from Tidy Tuesday project
[Link](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2019/2019-10-01)


```{r}
pizza<-read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2019/2019-10-01/pizza_jared.csv")

pizza %>% head
```

#Discrete vs continous variables

A **discrete** variable: a variable whose value is obtained by counting. 

Examples: 1, 2, 4

A **continuous** variable: a variable whose value is obtained by measuring. 

Examples: 1.4, 2.78, 4.54

We can use `skimr` package to easily see the types of variables. 

`summary()` is another base R function that can do this in a less visual way.

**Task**: use Help to read about `skimr` package and `summary()` function uses.

Use both functions to see variables in the `pizza` dataset

# Working with variables in R

```{r}

class(pizza$polla_qid)
class(pizza$percent)
```
---
# Categorical/Ordinal variables 

a variable that can take on one of a limited, and usually fixed, number of possible values

Called `Factors` in R

```{r}
class(pizza$answer)
```

not factor yet!

To make it factor let's try 

```{r}
pizza$answer<-as_factor(pizza$answer)

class(pizza$answer)
```

# Factors

R uses `factors` to handle categorical variables

Factors are also helpful for reordering character vectors to improve display.

---
#Task

Explore the dataset and think about where else we need to use factors. 
Make the correction necessary 

Use `glimpse()` to show the variable types

---
# Major functions to work with factors

fct_reorder(): Reordering a factor by another variable.

fct_infreq(): Reordering a factor by the frequency of values.

fct_relevel(): Changing the order of a factor by hand.

fct_lump(): Collapsing the least/most frequent values of a factor into “other”.

---
#Text

- Characters vs strings

Strings are not glamorous, high-profile components of R, but they do play a big role in many data cleaning and preparation tasks. 

The `stringr` package provide a cohesive set of functions designed to make working with strings as easy as possible.

# Working with strings

Cheatsheet https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/blob/master/strings.pdf

**Task**: review the dataset and see how main string functions can be applied


---
# Dates

Date-time data can be frustrating to work with in R. 

R commands for date-times are generally unintuitive and change depending on the type of date-time object being used. 

Moreover, the methods we use with date-times must be robust to time zones, leap days, daylight savings times, and other time related quirks, and R lacks these capabilities in some situations. 

Lubridate makes it easier to do the things R does with date-times and possible to do the things R does not.

If you are new to lubridate, the best place to start is the date and times chapter in R for data science.
